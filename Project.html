    but unfortunately on the very last weekend before the city shutdown, I got sick.</center></p>

  <p><center><p class="a">Usually on weekends I would go out and meet my friends at a bar downtown. 
  We would sometimes meet with other friends and go bar hopping around the city. 
  Throughout the week Iâ€™d go to school or work, I had recently started going back to school and met someone there. 
  We would meet up after my night class ended and go driving around the city, we would have so much fun. 
  Unfortunately Covid-19 happened and all future plans and events were cancelled.</center></p>
